# CHECKS (by ID — violations route by ID):
#   L1 — Version/Changelog Parity: frontmatter version > "1.0" requires at least one
#        changelog entry (Form A: frontmatter `changelog:` key, or Form B: `## Changelog`
#        body section). Codifies lesson L-010 (Gate #28) as a mechanical gate.
#        Routing: state-manager (frontmatter fix) or spec owner (changelog authoring).
#
#   L7 — Changelog Monotonic Order: version entries in a `## Changelog` body section
#        must appear in non-increasing (newest-first) order. A version number found AFTER
#        a strictly lower version number is a violation.
#        Routing: spec owner (reorder changelog entries so newest appears first).
#
#   L9 — Line-Cite and Version-Pin Ban (D-50 extended, 2026-07-24):
#        L9a (original): newly-authored lines must not contain file:NNN line-number
#        citations of the form `word.ext:digits`.
#        L9b (D-50): newly-authored lines must not contain `<doc> vN.N` version pins
#        (e.g. `ADR-014 v1.2`, `BC-2.01.001 v1.0`, `error-taxonomy.md v1.31`).
#        Both sub-checks use `git diff HEAD` restricted to `+` addition lines (not
#        deletions, not context). L9b uses a Python3 scanner (Bug 1 fix; avoids
#        VERSION_PIN_PATTERN alternation-precedence issues in embedded grep ERE).
#        .factory/hooks/** excluded from diff: hook scripts are code, not records.
#        Changelog entries and YAML frontmatter are IN SCOPE — D-50 targets version
#        pins wherever they live. The sole grandfathering mechanism is the entry-
#        date boundary: a + line whose YYYY-MM-DD date is before 2026-07-24 is
#        exempt (pre-D-50 text); no parseable date → in scope. This deliberately
#        disagrees with verify-no-version-pins.sh (full-corpus; changelog exempt).
#        Routing: finding author (replace file:NNN with symbol/anchor cite; replace
#                 doc vN.N with doc §Section-Anchor).
#
#   L10 — Hash-Digest Ban (ADVISORY): newly-authored changelog prose must not contain
#        standalone 7-hex-literal git SHA fragments (e.g. `5fc3abe → baaf36d`). These
#        are volatile pins of the TD-VSDD-091 family — they decay on the next refresh
#        with nothing to detect the stale reference. The compliant form names the upstream
#        artifact and section: `input-hash refreshed (ADR-014 §Decision 2 edited)`.
#        ADVISORY: non-blocking WARN in FIX-BURST-276 (Wave A). Promotion to blocking
#        after Wave B closes finding IDs P1D-173-L10-class in verification-properties/.
#        Exclusion: YAML hash-field assignments (HASH_FIELD_EXCLUSION); Rust numeric
#        literal type-suffix tokens (CE5/RUST_LITERAL_EXCL — e.g. `1e20f32` in VP prose
#        documents floating-point overflow behavior, not a content hash).
#        Routing: finding author (replace 7-hex SHA with artifact+section anchor cite).
#
#   L11 — Content-Hash Digest Ban (BLOCKING): newly-authored record/changelog/spec prose
#        must not contain standalone 8+ character lowercase hex digest literals. These are
#        the TD-VSDD-091 volatile-pin family at the content-hash level — citing a raw
#        hash value (SHA-1, SHA-256, MD5, or longer partial digest) as evidence of
#        input-file identity creates a reference that goes stale the moment the input
#        changes, with no behavioral anchor a future pass can verify against. Closes
#        F-P173-505 (FIX-BURST-276 Wave B). Existing text in HEAD is grandfathered via
#        the same `git diff HEAD` scoping as L9. Corpus-wide grandfathered count: ~75
#        lines across ~22 files; state-manager owns the cleanup schedule.
#        Exclusions (lines matching ANY of CE1–CE4 are exempt):
#          CE1 — YAML frontmatter hash-field assignments (`input-hash:`, `develop_head:`,
#                `frozen_head:`, etc.); the field VALUE is legitimate structured metadata.
#          CE2 — Frozen-HEAD citation lines (`**Frozen HEAD:**`, etc.); validated by
#                verify-sha-currency.sh — the only sanctioned prose SHA citations.
#          CE3 — `[live-state]` sentinel lines; ephemeral wrap-state markers replaced
#                each session, validated by verify-sha-currency.sh.
#          CE4 — Rust toolchain build-hash format `(HEX YYYY-MM-DD)` from `rustc -V`.
#        Known scope boundary: uppercase hex (`ABC123...`) is out of scope — all hash
#        outputs in this project are lowercase; uppercase appears only in Rust code
#        literals (`0xDEADBEEF`) where the `x` prefix prevents `\b` word-boundary match.
#        CE5/RUST_LITERAL_EXCL applies to L11 as well: Rust float literals (`1e200f64`,
#        `3e38f128`) and binary literals (`0b10101010`) that produce 8+ hex-looking char
#        sequences are excluded; they document numeric ranges in VP bodies, not hash pins.
#        Routing: finding author (replace hex digest literal with artifact+section anchor
#                 cite, e.g. `input-hash refreshed (ADR-014 §Decision 2 edited)`).
#
#   L12 — Dead-Brand-Token Recurrence Guard (BLOCKING): newly-authored additions in
#        specs/**/*.md must not contain ferrochain-era brand tokens:
#        `ferrochain`, `ferroctmp`, `ferrograph`, `FerrochainError` (case-insensitive).
#        Scoped to specs/ tree ONLY — planning/ is explicitly out of scope (legitimate
#        rename documentation, naming-decision-study, rename-sweep-manifest, and
#        decisions-archive all live there). Existing content in HEAD is grandfathered
#        via git diff HEAD scoping (covers ADR-010 lines 19/179 FerrochainError corrective
#        notes without needing explicit per-file allowlist entries).
#        Exclusions:
#          DE1 — Historical/clarifier qualifiers: lines where the dead brand token
#                appears adjacent to a rename/historical marker. Covers: "formerly
#                'ferrograph'", "renamed from ferrochain", "ferrochain-era",
#                "ferrochain→pregolya" (transition arrow), "not FerrochainError".
#          DE2 — Scoping: planning/ files are out of scope (diff restricted to specs/).
#        Routing: finding author (replace dead brand token with canonical pregolya-*
#                 equivalent: ferrochain→pregolya, ferrograph→pregolya-graph,
#                 ferroctmp→pregolya-checkpoint, FerrochainError→PregolyaError).

# L9 version-pin class pattern (D-50, ratified 2026-07-24).
#
# TD-VSDD-091 extended to `<doc> vN.N` version pins in text authored on or
# after 2026-07-24.  Examples of violations:
#   ADR-014 v1.2      BC-2.01.001 v1.0    VP-003 v1.1    CAP-001 v1.2
#   error-taxonomy.md v1.31               error-taxonomy.md (v1.31, D23)
#
# The 2026-07-24 date boundary is enforced via two mechanisms:
# (a) git diff HEAD: only `+` addition lines are checked (not deletions, context).
# (b) Entry-date extraction: `+` lines carrying a YYYY-MM-DD date before 2026-07-24
#     are grandfathered (pre-D-50 entries authored before the rule was ratified).
#     Lines with no parseable date are in scope.
#
# Scope note: changelog entries and YAML frontmatter are IN SCOPE for L9b. D-50
# specifically targets these regions because version pins live almost exclusively
# in changelog entries. The date boundary is meaningful precisely BECAUSE changelogs
# are in scope — it grandfathers pre-ratification text while catching newly-authored
# pins. This deliberately disagrees with verify-no-version-pins.sh (full-corpus
# scan; changelogs exempt) — the two rules have different scoping rationales.
#
# Pattern covers the same forms as verify-no-version-pins.sh PIN_RE (burst-288 parity):
#   1. ADR-NNN vX.Y       2. BC-2.SS.NNN vX.Y   3. VP-NNN vX.Y
#   4. CAP-NNN vX.Y       5. XXX-INDEX vX.Y (VP-INDEX, BC-INDEX, ARCH-INDEX, etc. — burst-288)

# 8-char minimum is the complement of L10's 7-char scope: captures SHA-1 (40 chars),

# L11 EXCLUSIONS — lines matching ANY of CE1-CE4 are exempt from L11.
#
# CE1: YAML frontmatter hash-field assignments. The field VALUE is legitimate structured
#      metadata; what is forbidden is restating that value as prose evidence. Covers all

#      develop_head and adversarial-pass-record frozen_head fields.

# CE2: Frozen-HEAD citation lines — sanctioned by verify-sha-currency.sh. These are the
#      only prose SHA citations the project allows; verify-sha-currency.sh validates each
#      one against the actual git ref. Covers: `**Frozen HEAD:** commit (...)`, `frozen
#      HEAD burst-NNN`, `Frozen HEAD (burst-NNN commit, SHA ...)`. Case-insensitive on
#      all letters via explicit character classes; accepts `-` or space as separator.
#      Note: "HEAD" in git parlance is always uppercase; "head" (lowercase) is less common.

#      by verify-sha-currency.sh. Matched as a literal string (brackets are not regex here).
# Note: grep -F is used for CE3 in check_l11 (literal bracket-string match).

# CE4: Rust toolchain build-hash format. `rustc -V` emits `X.Y.Z (NNNNNNNN YYYY-MM-DD)`;
#      this appears in preflight reports and toolchain verification tables. The
#      `(HEX YYYY-MM-DD)` parenthesized form is unambiguous toolchain identity metadata.
CONTENT_HASH_CE4='\([0-9a-f]{6,12}[[:space:]]+[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}\)'

# CE5 / RUST_LITERAL_EXCL — Rust numeric literals that produce hex-shaped tokens.
# Applied to BOTH L10 and L11. Two sub-cases:
#
#   (a) Float literals with Rust type suffixes where all suffix chars are lowercase hex:
#       `f32`, `f64`, `f16`, `f128`. Examples: `1e20f32` (7 chars, L10 scope),
#       `1e200f64` (8 chars, L11 scope), `3e38f128` (8 chars, L11 scope).
#       Token must start with a digit (distinguishing from hash strings starting a-f).
#       These appear in VP changelogs documenting IEEE-754 overflow behavior — the HIGHEST
#       density co-location of legitimate Rust float literals AND potential hash digests.
#
#   (b) Binary integer literals: `0b[01]+` sequences. Binary digits (0 and 1) are
#       both valid hex chars, so `0b10101010` (10 chars) matches `[0-9a-f]{8,}`.
#       The `0b` prefix unambiguously identifies these as binary literals, not content pins.
#       Hex literals (`0x...`) do NOT need exclusion: the `x` char is not in `[0-9a-f]`,
#       so the `0x` prefix breaks the match before the hex digits begin.
#
# Trade-off: CE5 is applied at the LINE level. A line containing BOTH a Rust float literal
# AND a real hash digest would be skipped (false negative). This is an accepted trade-off:
# changelog entries mixing numeric Rust literals with hash citations should be split.

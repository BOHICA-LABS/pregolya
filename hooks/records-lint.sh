# CHECKS (by ID — violations route by ID):
#   L1 — Version/Changelog Parity: frontmatter version > "1.0" requires at least one
#        changelog entry (Form A: frontmatter `changelog:` key, or Form B: `## Changelog`
#        body section). Codifies lesson L-010 (Gate #28) as a mechanical gate.
#        Routing: state-manager (frontmatter fix) or spec owner (changelog authoring).
#
#   L7 — Changelog Monotonic Order: version entries in a `## Changelog` body section
#        must appear in non-increasing (newest-first) order. A version number found AFTER
#        a strictly lower version number is a violation.
#        Routing: spec owner (reorder changelog entries so newest appears first).
#
#   L9 — Line-Cite and Version-Pin Ban (D-50 + P2A-050 extended, 2026-08-25):
#        L9a (extended, P2A-050 2026-08-25 + DC-29/F-PDC29-03 2026-09-08):
#        newly-authored lines must not contain any of four volatile line-citation
#        forms. All four decay on the next diff and rot the trace (TD-VSDD-091 /
#        POL-12); all use addition-only git diff HEAD scoping (hooks excluded; no
#        separate date-boundary required):
#          (i)   file:NNN — line-number citations of the form `word.ext:digits`
#                (the original L9a form; e.g. `lib.rs:42`, `CLAUDE.md:156`)
#         (ii)   bare line references — `line ~N` or `line N` in normative prose
#                (e.g. `§Changelog line ~44`; caught by BARE_LINE_CITE_PATTERN)
#        (iii)   ID-anchored line pins — `DOCID:NNN` citations
#                (e.g. `BC-2.10.001:141`, `ADR-020:224`; caught by ID_LINE_PIN_PATTERN)
#         (iv)   prose file:line — `filename.ext line NNN` or `filename.ext lines NNN`
#                (e.g. `api-surface.md line 258`; caught by PROSE_LINE_CITE_PATTERN)
#                Anchoring on the `.ext` before `line NNN` avoids false-positives
#                from compound words ending in "line" (pipeline, baseline, guideline,
#                deadline, timeline, airline, etc.).
#                Closes hook-coverage gap F-PDC29-03 (DC-29, 2026-09-08).
#        L9b (D-50): newly-authored lines must not contain `<doc> vN.N` version pins
#        (e.g. `ADR-014 v1.2`, `BC-2.01.001 v1.0`, `error-taxonomy.md v1.31`).
#        L9a sub-checks use `git diff HEAD` restricted to `+` addition lines (not
#        deletions, not context). L9b uses a Python3 scanner (Bug 1 fix; avoids
#        VERSION_PIN_PATTERN alternation-precedence issues in embedded grep ERE).
#        .factory/hooks/** excluded from diff: hook scripts are code, not records.
#        Changelog entries and YAML frontmatter are IN SCOPE — D-50 targets version
#        pins wherever they live. The sole grandfathering mechanism for L9b is the
#        entry-date boundary: a + line whose YYYY-MM-DD date is before 2026-07-24 is
#        exempt (pre-D-50 text); no parseable date → in scope. This deliberately
#        disagrees with verify-no-version-pins.sh (full-corpus; changelog exempt).
#        L9a (all four forms) grandfathers pre-existing committed content via the
#        addition-only `git diff HEAD` scoping — no date-boundary needed.
#        Routing: finding author (replace file:NNN / bare line~N / DOCID:NNN /
#                 file.ext line NNN with symbol/anchor cite; replace doc vN.N with
#                 doc §Section-Anchor).
#
#   L10 — Hash-Digest Ban (ADVISORY): newly-authored changelog prose must not contain
#        standalone 7-hex-literal git SHA fragments (e.g. `5fc3abe → baaf36d`). These
#        are volatile pins of the TD-VSDD-091 family — they decay on the next refresh
#        with nothing to detect the stale reference. The compliant form names the upstream
#        artifact and section: `input-hash refreshed (ADR-014 §Decision 2 edited)`.
#        ADVISORY: non-blocking WARN in FIX-BURST-276 (Wave A). Promotion to blocking
#        after Wave B closes finding IDs P1D-173-L10-class in verification-properties/.
#        Exclusion: YAML hash-field assignments (HASH_FIELD_EXCLUSION); Rust numeric
#        literal type-suffix tokens (CE5/RUST_LITERAL_EXCL — e.g. `1e20f32` in VP prose
#        documents floating-point overflow behavior, not a content hash).
#        Routing: finding author (replace 7-hex SHA with artifact+section anchor cite).
#
#   L11 — Content-Hash Digest Ban (BLOCKING): newly-authored record/changelog/spec prose
#        must not contain standalone 8+ character lowercase hex digest literals. These are
#        the TD-VSDD-091 volatile-pin family at the content-hash level — citing a raw
#        hash value (SHA-1, SHA-256, MD5, or longer partial digest) as evidence of
#        input-file identity creates a reference that goes stale the moment the input
#        changes, with no behavioral anchor a future pass can verify against. Closes
#        F-P173-505 (FIX-BURST-276 Wave B). Existing text in HEAD is grandfathered via
#        the same `git diff HEAD` scoping as L9. Corpus-wide grandfathered count: ~75
#        lines across ~22 files; state-manager owns the cleanup schedule.
#        Exclusions (lines matching ANY of CE1–CE4 are exempt):
#          CE1 — YAML frontmatter hash-field assignments (`input-hash:`, `develop_head:`,
#                `frozen_head:`, etc.); the field VALUE is legitimate structured metadata.
#          CE2 — Frozen-HEAD citation lines (`**Frozen HEAD:**`, etc.); validated by
#                verify-sha-currency.sh — the only sanctioned prose SHA citations.
#          CE3 — `[live-state]` sentinel lines; ephemeral wrap-state markers replaced
#                each session, validated by verify-sha-currency.sh.
#          CE4 — Rust toolchain build-hash format `(HEX YYYY-MM-DD)` from `rustc -V`.
#        Known scope boundary: uppercase hex (`ABC123...`) is out of scope — all hash
#        outputs in this project are lowercase; uppercase appears only in Rust code
#        literals (`0xDEADBEEF`) where the `x` prefix prevents `\b` word-boundary match.
#        CE5/RUST_LITERAL_EXCL applies to L11 as well: Rust float literals (`1e200f64`,
#        `3e38f128`) and binary literals (`0b10101010`) that produce 8+ hex-looking char
#        sequences are excluded; they document numeric ranges in VP bodies, not hash pins.
#        Routing: finding author (replace hex digest literal with artifact+section anchor
#                 cite, e.g. `input-hash refreshed (ADR-014 §Decision 2 edited)`).
#
#   L12 — Dead-Brand-Token Recurrence Guard (BLOCKING): newly-authored additions in
#        specs/**/*.md must not contain ferrochain-era brand tokens:
#        `ferrochain`, `ferroctmp`, `ferrograph`, `FerrochainError` (case-insensitive).
#        Scoped to specs/ tree ONLY — planning/ is explicitly out of scope (legitimate
#        rename documentation, naming-decision-study, rename-sweep-manifest, and
#        decisions-archive all live there). Existing content in HEAD is grandfathered
#        via git diff HEAD scoping (covers ADR-010 lines 19/179 FerrochainError corrective
#        notes without needing explicit per-file allowlist entries).
#        Exclusions:
#          DE1 — Historical/clarifier qualifiers: lines where the dead brand token
#                appears adjacent to a rename/historical marker. Covers: "formerly
#                'ferrograph'", "renamed from ferrochain", "ferrochain-era",
#                "ferrochain→pregolya" (transition arrow), "not FerrochainError".
#          DE2 — Scoping: planning/ files are out of scope (diff restricted to specs/).
#        Routing: finding author (replace dead brand token with canonical pregolya-*
#                 equivalent: ferrochain→pregolya, ferrograph→pregolya-graph,
#                 ferroctmp→pregolya-checkpoint, FerrochainError→PregolyaError).
#
#   L13 — STATE.md D-NNN Parity (BLOCKING): the newest D-NNN decision number in
#        STATE.md's §Current Phase Steps table rows of the form
#        `| D-NNN/YYYY-MM-DD` carrying a `| COMPLETE |` status column (IN FLIGHT
#        rows excluded) must equal the D-NNN referenced in §Session Resume Checkpoint
#        (canonical forms: "D-NNN checkpoint is current" in the archival comment,
#        OR "post-D-NNN state" in the §RESUME NEXT-ACTIONS heading) AND the
#        §Convergence Status section (terminal bold **D-NNN entry; max number
#        taken). Prevents the recurring checkpoint-staleness defect class:
#        F-P39-MED-001, F-P40-MED-003, F-P41-MED-001 (5 consecutive recurrences;
#        PGAP-RECORDS-LINT-FIXBURST-PARITY). Positive-coverage log line on PASS so
#        the check cannot go silently inert.
#        Blocking FAIL (vacuity guards, F-P42-MED-005): STATE.md absent; zero
#        `| D-NNN/YYYY-MM-DD … | COMPLETE |` rows in §Current Phase Steps;
#        §Session Resume Checkpoint section absent or containing no D-NNN.
#        Blocking FAIL (frozen-HEAD currency, F-P46-MED-002 + F-P46-HIGH-001):
#        frozen HEAD from §Session Resume Checkpoint not found in any COMPLETE row;
#        checkpoint frozen HEAD does not match live feature branch HEAD.
#        Genuine skip (no assertion): §Convergence Status section absent or
#        containing no `**D-NNN` bold entry (pre-convergence state — check emits
#        a SKIPPED label, not FAIL).
#        Self-probes: seven probes exercise this check (A: checkpoint-stale,
#        B: convergence-stale, C: clean-pass, D: checkpoint-absent, E: convergence-absent,
#        F: frozen-head-not-in-complete, G: frozen-head-live-mismatch).
#        Routing: state-manager (propagate newest D-NNN to §Session Resume
#                 Checkpoint and §Convergence Status).
#
# SELF-PROBE: Each check self-probes against a synthetic violation before running on
#             the real corpus. A self-probe failure means the check would be false-green —
#             the script exits 2 immediately (script bug, not lint violation).

#
# Form (i): file:NNN — word.ext:digits where ext is a known code/doc extension.
# Catches: lib.rs:42  CLAUDE.md:156  Cargo.toml:8  api-surface.md:23
# Does NOT catch: version strings (v1.2.3), URLs, colon-delimited identifiers

LINE_CITE_PATTERN='\b[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+\.(rs|md|toml|yaml|yml|ts|js|py|json|sh|txt):[0-9]{1,6}\b'

# Form (ii): bare line reference — `line ~N` or `line N` in normative prose.
# Catches: "line ~44", "line 224", "line ~36" (the P2A-050 live-violation shape:
#   "§Changelog line ~44" passed the old L9a gate; this closes the gap).
# Does NOT catch: "pipeline", "baseline", "online" (no word boundary before "line"),

BARE_LINE_CITE_PATTERN='\bline[[:space:]]+~?[0-9]{1,6}\b'

# Form (iii): ID-anchored line pin — DOCID:NNN (doc identifier followed by colon+digits).
# Catches: "BC-2.10.001:141", "ADR-020:224", "VP-003:36", "CAP-001:12"
# These are doc-ID:line-number citations — equally volatile as file:NNN citations.
# Does NOT catch: "BC-2.10.001:" without trailing digits (YAML key syntax), or

# Anchored on a known code/doc file extension immediately before `lines?` + digits.

# L9 version-pin class pattern (D-50, ratified 2026-07-24).
#
# TD-VSDD-091 extended to `<doc> vN.N` version pins in text authored on or
# after 2026-07-24.  Examples of violations:
#   ADR-014 v1.2      BC-2.01.001 v1.0    VP-003 v1.1    CAP-001 v1.2
#   error-taxonomy.md v1.31               error-taxonomy.md (v1.31, D23)
#
# The 2026-07-24 date boundary is enforced via two mechanisms:
# (a) git diff HEAD: only `+` addition lines are checked (not deletions, context).
# (b) Entry-date extraction: `+` lines carrying a YYYY-MM-DD date before 2026-07-24
#     are grandfathered (pre-D-50 entries authored before the rule was ratified).
#     Lines with no parseable date are in scope.
#
# Scope note: changelog entries and YAML frontmatter are IN SCOPE for L9b. D-50
# specifically targets these regions because version pins live almost exclusively
# in changelog entries. The date boundary is meaningful precisely BECAUSE changelogs
# are in scope — it grandfathers pre-ratification text while catching newly-authored
# pins. This deliberately disagrees with verify-no-version-pins.sh (full-corpus
# scan; changelogs exempt) — the two rules have different scoping rationales.
#
# Pattern covers the same forms as verify-no-version-pins.sh PIN_RE (burst-288 parity):

#      all letters via explicit character classes; accepts `-` or space as separator.

# Note: grep -F is used for CE3 in check_l11 (literal bracket-string match).

# CE5 / RUST_LITERAL_EXCL — Rust numeric literals that produce hex-shaped tokens.
# Applied to BOTH L10 and L11. Two sub-cases:
#
#   (a) Float literals with Rust type suffixes where all suffix chars are lowercase hex:
#       `f32`, `f64`, `f16`, `f128`. Examples: `1e20f32` (7 chars, L10 scope),
#       `1e200f64` (8 chars, L11 scope), `3e38f128` (8 chars, L11 scope).
#       Token must start with a digit (distinguishing from hash strings starting a-f).
#       These appear in VP changelogs documenting IEEE-754 overflow behavior — the HIGHEST
#       density co-location of legitimate Rust float literals AND potential hash digests.
#
#   (b) Binary integer literals: `0b[01]+` sequences. Binary digits (0 and 1) are
#       both valid hex chars, so `0b10101010` (10 chars) matches `[0-9a-f]{8,}`.
#       The `0b` prefix unambiguously identifies these as binary literals, not content pins.
#       Hex literals (`0x...`) do NOT need exclusion: the `x` char is not in `[0-9a-f]`,
#       so the `0x` prefix breaks the match before the hex digits begin.
#
# Trade-off: CE5 is applied at the LINE level. A line containing BOTH a Rust float literal
# AND a real hash digest would be skipped (false negative). This is an accepted trade-off:
# changelog entries mixing numeric Rust literals with hash citations should be split.

| Step | Agent | Status | Output |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| adk-rust certification pass C9 (strict-zero, deepened corpus) | validate-extraction | COMPLETE | CLEAN(strict)=NO. 1 LOW correction: [C9-01] behavioral-intent A1 §5 RunConfig "12-field"→"11-field" (off-by-one; incidental find during budget-gap re-check; Domain-B gap re-confirmed: no budget field). 5/6 behavioral+citation confirmed. Novel probe: A6+A7 distributions 2/2 CONFIRMED — all 7 pass distributions verified. Streak RESET 1/3→0/3. Burst 52. |
| adk-rust certification pass C10 (strict-zero, deepened corpus) | validate-extraction | COMPLETE | CLEAN(strict)=NO. 1 LOW correction: [C10-01] P-86 Observation body enumerated 3 SSE parse loops (2 exist; C3-01 fixed Quality line only; same-block residue). MEMBER-COUNT CLASS CLOSED: 15/15 verified (7 new). Opener 1 CLEAN. Rotation 6/6 confirmed. Metrics 5/5 Delta=0 + 1 ~800→822 approx no-correction per precedent. Streak 0/3. Burst 53. |
| adk-rust certification pass C11 (strict-zero, deepened corpus) | validate-extraction | COMPLETE | CLEAN(strict)=YES. ZERO corrections. Opener: 17 corrected blocks re-read as units — ALL CONSISTENT (same-block partial-correction class DRAINED). Rotation 4/4 CONFIRMED (P-41 message_stream stub; P-07 SessionCleanup Drop; P-32 event plaintext; citation adk-sandbox 5 proptest files). Metrics: M-01 ~35→34 tilde no-correction per precedent; M-02 delta=0. Streak 0/3 → 1/3. Burst 54. |

## Decisions Log

| ID | Decision | Rationale | Phase | Date | Made By |
|----|----------|-----------|-------|------|---------|
| D1 | AMENDED (human-approved 2026-07-12): langchain-community full 1,051-module port REMOVED from scope. Upstream archived 2026-06-19 (sunset announcement issue #674; replaced by standalone packages + in-app tools + MCP). New integration strategy: (a) integration trait contracts in ferrochain-core, (b) ferrochain-standard-tests conformance suite (port of libs/standard-tests), (c) NEW ferrochain-mcp crate — port of langchain-mcp-adapters, (d) curated demand-ranked community integration crates post-v1, (e) long tail out-of-tree conformance-validated | langchain-community archived upstream — full port is dead scope; MCP adapter is the live integration surface | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D2 | Reference version: langchain==1.3.13 (SHA 42f8f79), langgraph==1.2.9 (SHA 95af6a0), langchain-community==v0.4.2 (SHA 7c10a5f; ARCHIVED — curated-subset reference only), langchain-mcp-adapters==0.3.0 (SHA a61c783a7949719a8c3fbe4aeba961f45f3b7849) | Latest stable v1 line; full pins in reference-manifest.md v1.4.0 (adk-rust Corpus 5 added per D16). | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D3 | Early integrations: OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama first; then full partner set | Unblocks core use-cases earliest | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D4 | Single Cargo workspace, one repo, one pipeline; crates publish individually | Simplest topology for first release cycle | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D5 | semport-analyze must emit dependency-disposition.md per package (map/port/eliminate); numpy→ndarray, pandas→polars default; pydantic→serde/schemars requires dedicated ADR before BCs | Prevents unreviewed dep choices propagating into BCs | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D6 | RESOLVED — ferrochain (distinct brand; scored 23/25 vs 14/25 for langchain-* suffix; `langchain_rs` name blocked by crates.io name-normalization collision). Crate family: ferrochain, ferrochain-core, ferrochain-graph, ferrochain-checkpoint, ferrochain-openai, ferrochain-anthropic, ferrochain-ollama, ferrochain-community, ferrochain-splitters. Final crate names get ADR in architecture phase. Evidence: .factory/planning/naming-decision-study.md | Distinct brand maximizes positioning; suffix scheme is blocked | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D7 | Wave priority: core → graph → partners. LangGraph runtime + durable checkpointing is the P0 lead differentiator and ships immediately after ferrochain-core | White space analysis confirms graph-runtime-with-checkpointing + conformance suite + formal verification is unoccupied; rig v0.40 competitor velocity HIGH — must lead with graph | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D8 | AMENDED (human directive, 2026-07-13): three holdout domains. Domains serve dual purpose: (1) DESIGN FORCING FUNCTIONS for Phase 1 (PRD/architecture capability checklist extended). (2) HOLDOUT SCENARIO DOMAINS for Phase 2. Domain A: Virtual SOC analyst. Domain B: Dark factory (VSDD-style). Domain C: OpenClaw-like personal AI assistant (persistent sessions, multi-channel, local-first). | Domain C surfaces persistent-session + multi-channel + local-first gaps; all three extend Phase 1 checklist | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D9 | ferrochain-graph design consultation gate. Before ANY graph execution-model ADR is finalized, architect MUST present ≥2 alternatives with production trade-offs to human. /Users/jmagady/Dev/vsdd-factory is PRIOR ART / EVIDENCE, NOT a template. Gate applies at Phase 1c. | Human mandate: design conversation before ADR lock on highest-risk component | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D10 | Production-grade constitution adopted. /Users/jmagady/Dev/ferrochain/CLAUDE.md (553 lines) authored by technical-writer from full harvest of /Users/jmagady/Dev/prism/CLAUDE.md per human mandate. NOTE: CLAUDE.md on main, no initial commit yet — committed at workspace-init Phase 1 by devops. | Human mandate: production-grade agent constitution before Phase 1 | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D11 | ferrochain-graph design steers (D9 early conversation; formal ADR at Phase 1c). D11.1 HYBRID engine (orchestrator-loop per run + actor-style outer scheduler). D11.2 RUST-NATIVE msgpack checkpoint format (NOT Python-compatible; one-way import tool). D11.3 All three durability tiers ported; ferrochain DEFAULTS to sync (crash-safe). | Human design-conversation preceding D9 gate | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D12 | File size & module splitting standard (human-approved; .factory/planning/file-size-standard-study.md). Production: 500 code-lines soft / 750 hard (CI fail). Tests: 1,000 soft / 1,500 hard. CI: `cargo xtask check-file-size`. Exceptions: xtask/file-size-allowlist.toml. | Human hypothesis CONFIRMED by research | pre-1 | 2026-07-13 | human |
| D13 | ferrochain-server is first-party (human directive). (1) Built in-workspace. (2) NO wire-compatibility with LangGraph Platform. (3) DTU scope = genuine third parties only: OpenAI, Anthropic, providers, Ollama. Pass-6 "stateful fake" RETIRED. ferrochain-server gets full BCs/holdouts. | First-party server unifies design surface; eliminates DTU conformance burden | pre-1 | 2026-07-13 | human |
| D14 | REAFFIRMED UNAMENDED (human, Level-2 escalation). AMENDED D14.1 (human-approved): exhaustive-sweep-then-3-CLEAN protocol. 7 parallel area validators; exhaustive coverage precedes certification. D14 strict-zero bar UNCHANGED: CLEAN(strict) = zero findings; 3 consecutive required. | Sampling does not converge; coverage precedes certification; strict-zero preserved | pre-1 | 2026-07-13 | human |
| D15 | PERSISTENT HUMAN DIRECTIVE: "Keep going until you hit convergence protocol." Autonomous continuation; no check-ins on gate patience. COMPLETED — extraction gate closed at burst 37. | Human mandate: no orchestrator check-in overhead during convergence loop | pre-1 | 2026-07-13 | human |
| D16 | ACTIVE DIRECTIVE (human, 2026-07-13): adk-rust comparative corpus. TRIGGERED at extraction gate closure. adk-rust v1.0.0 (SHA a6c79b6f) as Corpus 5; identical rigor (analysis → exhaustive sweep → 3-CLEAN). RUST-BLINDNESS RULE: language carries zero evidentiary weight; patterns win on production-grade merit only. Full comparative assessment → all outcomes on table → HUMAN DIRECTION GATE → Phase 1. | Human mandate to evaluate adk-rust with zero language bias; anti-sunk-cost explicit; goal = best product | pre-1 | 2026-07-13 | human |

## Risk Register

| ID | Risk | Severity | Affects | Notes |
|----|------|----------|---------|-------|
| R1 | langgraph `scheduler-kafka` confirmed removed from langgraph 1.2.9. With D1 amended, treat as out-of-scope unless architecture finds a dependency | Low | Phase 1/3 | Effectively resolved by D1 amendment |
| R2 | langchain-community stable is 0.4.x; v1.0.0a1 tagged — API churn risk for community wave | Medium | Phase 3 | Phase community work last per D1 roadmap |
| R3 | DTU scope revised per D13 — ferrochain-server is first-party. DTU = OpenAI, Anthropic, provider APIs, Ollama keyless CI. Pass-6 "stateful fake" RETIRED. | Low | Phase 1 | Direction resolved by D13 |
| R4 | Competing active `langgraph` crate on crates.io (updated 2026-07-01) — positioning risk | Medium | Phase 1 | Feeds market-intelligence-assessment gate |
| R5 | Three incompatible tag conventions across reference repos — tag-sort bug already triggered (langgraph mis-pinned at 0.3.34, corrected) | Low | Tooling | Semport tooling must handle all three |
| R6 | crates.io names verified available; GitHub=BOHICA-LABS/ferrochain registered; publish-all.sh prepped — human has NOT yet run publish-all.sh (cargo login required). Time-sensitive. | High | pre-1 | Pending human action: `cargo login` + run publish-all.sh to reserve all ferrochain-* crate names |
| R7 | langchain-protocol v0.0.17 — no stable release; schema evolving. Port rationale is version-volatility, not immaturity (v3 streaming has 107 dedicated tests — corrected cert pass 9). | Low | Phase 1/3 | DOWNGRADED from Medium; full schema in .factory/semport/core/ANALYSIS-STATE.md |
| R8 | Splitters code-point vs byte-length parity: upstream `len()` calls on text are code-point counts — different split boundaries on non-ASCII. NOT covered by any upstream test. | High | Phase 1/3 | CRITICAL parity risk. Must become explicit BC + holdout scenario. Route to product-owner at Phase 1. |
| R9 | Platform API churn re-classified per D13 — SDK-1.2.9 endpoint catalog is design reference only; no conformance target. | Low | Phase 1 | Severity downgraded per D13 |
| R10 | Upstream coverage gap: NamedBarrierValue has NO dedicated unit test. EphemeralValue only 3 assert lines. Product-owner must author BCs + tests from behavior. | Medium | Phase 1 | Route to product-owner at Phase 1 |
| R11 | MCP upstream test voids: (1) mcp bare-ToolException re-raise path untested; (2) mcp `__aenter__` NotImplementedError contract untested. Same class as R8 and R10. | Medium | Phase 1/3 | Route to product-owner at Phase 1: must become explicit Red Gate tests |

## Skip Log

| Step | Skipped? | Justification |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Phase 0: Codebase Ingestion | yes | Greenfield — no existing Rust codebase to ingest. Replaced by semport-analyze of Python reference corpus. |

## Blocking Issues

<!-- Open issues only. Move resolved issues to cycles/v0.0.0-pre-pipeline/blocking-issues-resolved.md. -->

| ID | Issue | Severity | Blocking Phase | Owner | Resolution |
|----|-------|----------|----------------|-------|------------|
| B1 | direnv not allowed — .envrc present but unenabled; 4 AWS/Anthropic key names declared | Low | pre-1 | human | Run `direnv allow .` from project root |

Novel probe: per-crate summary figures vs test-inventory.md A1 — 5/5 CONSISTENT across all core crates. Streak 1/3 → 2/3. C13 DISPATCHED (potential closing pass; zero closes at 3/3; any finding resets). |
| **Key context** | D1-D16 locked. D16 ACTIVE: Rust-blindness rule. Analysis CONVERGED (Condition 1 MET). 3-CLEAN streak at 2/3 — ONE MORE ZERO CLOSES GATE. KEY GAPS (CONFIRMED): Domain A guardrail gap (P-59 UNMET), bare-String API keys (P-76), non-isolating default sandbox, reqwest timeout-less SYSTEMIC (confirmed exact 69/73 sites, A6-C1). P-71 RULED: STRONG STANDS (9/12). After 3-CLEAN: comparative assessment → HUMAN DIRECTION GATE → Phase 1. R6/R8/R10/R11 OPEN. UNVERIFIABLE items unchanged (scc LOC, 4 a2a-v1 runtime items, adk-anthropic/src/types ~60 vs 82 approx.). |

# Pipeline State: ferrochain

## Project Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Product** | ferrochain (RESOLVED D6 — formerly working name langchain-rs; physical rename pending repo-init B2) |
| **Repository** | /Users/jmagady/Dev/ferrochain |
| **Mode** | greenfield + semport (Python→Rust semantic port) |
| **Language** | Rust (target), Python (reference corpus) |
| **Target Workspace** | Single Cargo workspace (D4) |
| **Reference Corpus** | .reference/ (gitignored) — langchain==1.3.13, langgraph==1.2.9, langchain-community==v0.4.2 (curated-subset), langchain-mcp-adapters==0.3.0 (SHA a61c783a), adk-rust v1.0.0 (SHA a6c79b6f, Corpus 5 per D16). Full pins: semport/reference-manifest.md v1.4.0 |
| **Started** | 2026-07-12 |
| **Last Updated** | 2026-07-13 — burst 42: C1 COMPLETE. CLEAN(strict)=NO. 1 MEDIUM correction (behavioral-intent A5 execute_with_retry exception list: 1→3 exceptions named). Housekeeping applied (excluded from verdict): P-77 8-sites confirmed, 262 canonical propagated (7 stale test-count figures fixed), P-71 TAG-REVIEW RULED STRONG STANDS (9/12 coverage, 3 architecturally-grounded exceptions). Streak 0/3. CONVERGENCE DEFINITION CORRECTED: requires BOTH (a) analysis novelty-LOW + explicit CONVERGED verdict AND (b) 3-CLEAN strict-zero. A6 deepening dispatched to close depth gaps. C2 HELD (frozen-HEAD rule — A6 will modify corpus). |
| **Current Phase** | pre-1 (pre-pipeline) |
| **Current Step** | A6 convergence deepening in progress; C2 queued behind A6 (frozen-HEAD rule); streak 0/3. |

| Step | Agent | Status | Output |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| adk-rust pass A3 (server/platform/protocols) | codebase-analyzer | COMPLETE | 12P P-35..P-46 (4S/2N/6W). A2A stream+background = STUBS. SSRF webhooks (P-35), 7 reqwest zero-timeout (P-42), message_stream stub (P-41), budget-governance gap NET-NEW (P-46). Burst 39. |
| adk-rust passes A4+A5 (safety+quality / provider+capability) | codebase-analyzer | COMPLETE | A4: 20P P-47..P-66. Domain A guardrail gap (P-59 UNMET), non-isolating default sandbox (P-60–P-62/P-65). A5: 13P P-67..P-79. P-16 REFUTED. Anyhow CLOSED. Bare-String API keys WORKSPACE-WIDE (P-76), 3 native-tls chains (P-79). Total: 79P (34S/15N/30W). Burst 40. |

Housekeeping: P-77 8-sites confirmed, 262 propagated (7 stale figs), P-71 STRONG STANDS ruling. Streak 0/3. Burst 42. |
| adk-rust pass A6 (convergence deepening: realtime state machine, sandbox backends, RAG depth, skill negative paths, A2A client, ignored-test census) | codebase-analyzer | IN-PROGRESS | Dispatched to close depth gaps left by A4/A5. C2 queued behind (frozen-HEAD rule). |

## Decisions Log

| ID | Decision | Rationale | Phase | Date | Made By |
|----|----------|-----------|-------|------|---------|
| D1 | AMENDED (human-approved 2026-07-12): langchain-community full 1,051-module port REMOVED from scope. Upstream archived 2026-06-19 (sunset announcement issue #674; replaced by standalone packages + in-app tools + MCP). New integration strategy: (a) integration trait contracts in ferrochain-core, (b) ferrochain-standard-tests conformance suite (port of libs/standard-tests), (c) NEW ferrochain-mcp crate — port of langchain-mcp-adapters, (d) curated demand-ranked community integration crates post-v1, (e) long tail out-of-tree conformance-validated | langchain-community archived upstream — full port is dead scope; MCP adapter is the live integration surface | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D2 | Reference version: langchain==1.3.13 (SHA 42f8f79), langgraph==1.2.9 (SHA 95af6a0), langchain-community==v0.4.2 (SHA 7c10a5f; ARCHIVED — curated-subset reference only), langchain-mcp-adapters==0.3.0 (SHA a61c783a7949719a8c3fbe4aeba961f45f3b7849) | Latest stable v1 line; full pins in reference-manifest.md v1.4.0 (adk-rust Corpus 5 added per D16). | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D3 | Early integrations: OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama first; then full partner set | Unblocks core use-cases earliest | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D4 | Single Cargo workspace, one repo, one pipeline; crates publish individually | Simplest topology for first release cycle | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D5 | semport-analyze must emit dependency-disposition.md per package (map/port/eliminate); numpy→ndarray, pandas→polars default; pydantic→serde/schemars requires dedicated ADR before BCs | Prevents unreviewed dep choices propagating into BCs | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D6 | RESOLVED — ferrochain (distinct brand; scored 23/25 vs 14/25 for langchain-* suffix; `langchain_rs` name blocked by crates.io name-normalization collision). Crate family: ferrochain, ferrochain-core, ferrochain-graph, ferrochain-checkpoint, ferrochain-openai, ferrochain-anthropic, ferrochain-ollama, ferrochain-community, ferrochain-splitters. Final crate names get ADR in architecture phase. Evidence: .factory/planning/naming-decision-study.md | Distinct brand maximizes positioning; suffix scheme is blocked | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D7 | Wave priority: core → graph → partners. LangGraph runtime + durable checkpointing is the P0 lead differentiator and ships immediately after ferrochain-core | White space analysis confirms graph-runtime-with-checkpointing + conformance suite + formal verification is unoccupied; rig v0.40 competitor velocity HIGH — must lead with graph | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D8 | AMENDED (human directive, 2026-07-13): three holdout domains. Domains serve dual purpose: (1) DESIGN FORCING FUNCTIONS for Phase 1 (PRD/architecture capability checklist extended). (2) HOLDOUT SCENARIO DOMAINS for Phase 2. Domain A: Virtual SOC analyst. Domain B: Dark factory (VSDD-style). Domain C: OpenClaw-like personal AI assistant (persistent sessions, multi-channel, local-first). | Domain C surfaces persistent-session + multi-channel + local-first gaps; all three extend Phase 1 checklist | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D9 | ferrochain-graph design consultation gate. Before ANY graph execution-model ADR is finalized, architect MUST present ≥2 alternatives with production trade-offs to human. /Users/jmagady/Dev/vsdd-factory is PRIOR ART / EVIDENCE, NOT a template. Gate applies at Phase 1c. | Human mandate: design conversation before ADR lock on highest-risk component | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D10 | Production-grade constitution adopted. /Users/jmagady/Dev/ferrochain/CLAUDE.md (553 lines) authored by technical-writer from full harvest of /Users/jmagady/Dev/prism/CLAUDE.md per human mandate. NOTE: CLAUDE.md on main, no initial commit yet — committed at workspace-init Phase 1 by devops. | Human mandate: production-grade agent constitution before Phase 1 | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D11 | ferrochain-graph design steers (D9 early conversation; formal ADR at Phase 1c). D11.1 HYBRID engine (orchestrator-loop per run + actor-style outer scheduler). D11.2 RUST-NATIVE msgpack checkpoint format (NOT Python-compatible; one-way import tool). D11.3 All three durability tiers ported; ferrochain DEFAULTS to sync (crash-safe). | Human design-conversation preceding D9 gate | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D12 | File size & module splitting standard (human-approved; .factory/planning/file-size-standard-study.md). Production: 500 code-lines soft / 750 hard (CI fail). Tests: 1,000 soft / 1,500 hard. CI: `cargo xtask check-file-size`. Exceptions: xtask/file-size-allowlist.toml. | Human hypothesis CONFIRMED by research | pre-1 | 2026-07-13 | human |
| D13 | ferrochain-server is first-party (human directive). (1) Built in-workspace. (2) NO wire-compatibility with LangGraph Platform. (3) DTU scope = genuine third parties only: OpenAI, Anthropic, providers, Ollama. Pass-6 "stateful fake" RETIRED. ferrochain-server gets full BCs/holdouts. | First-party server unifies design surface; eliminates DTU conformance burden | pre-1 | 2026-07-13 | human |
| D14 | REAFFIRMED UNAMENDED (human, Level-2 escalation). AMENDED D14.1 (human-approved): exhaustive-sweep-then-3-CLEAN protocol. 7 parallel area validators; exhaustive coverage precedes certification. D14 strict-zero bar UNCHANGED: CLEAN(strict) = zero findings; 3 consecutive required. | Sampling does not converge; coverage precedes certification; strict-zero preserved | pre-1 | 2026-07-13 | human |
| D15 | PERSISTENT HUMAN DIRECTIVE: "Keep going until you hit convergence protocol." Autonomous continuation; no check-ins on gate patience. COMPLETED — extraction gate closed at burst 37. | Human mandate: no orchestrator check-in overhead during convergence loop | pre-1 | 2026-07-13 | human |
| D16 | ACTIVE DIRECTIVE (human, 2026-07-13): adk-rust comparative corpus. TRIGGERED at extraction gate closure. adk-rust v1.0.0 (SHA a6c79b6f) as Corpus 5; identical rigor (analysis → exhaustive sweep → 3-CLEAN). RUST-BLINDNESS RULE: language carries zero evidentiary weight; patterns win on production-grade merit only. Full comparative assessment → all outcomes on table → HUMAN DIRECTION GATE → Phase 1. | Human mandate to evaluate adk-rust with zero language bias; anti-sunk-cost explicit; goal = best product | pre-1 | 2026-07-13 | human |

## Risk Register

| ID | Risk | Severity | Affects | Notes |
|----|------|----------|---------|-------|
| R1 | langgraph `scheduler-kafka` confirmed removed from langgraph 1.2.9. With D1 amended, treat as out-of-scope unless architecture finds a dependency | Low | Phase 1/3 | Effectively resolved by D1 amendment |
| R2 | langchain-community stable is 0.4.x; v1.0.0a1 tagged — API churn risk for community wave | Medium | Phase 3 | Phase community work last per D1 roadmap |
| R3 | DTU scope revised per D13 — ferrochain-server is first-party. DTU = OpenAI, Anthropic, provider APIs, Ollama keyless CI. Pass-6 "stateful fake" RETIRED. | Low | Phase 1 | Direction resolved by D13 |
| R4 | Competing active `langgraph` crate on crates.io (updated 2026-07-01) — positioning risk | Medium | Phase 1 | Feeds market-intelligence-assessment gate |
| R5 | Three incompatible tag conventions across reference repos — tag-sort bug already triggered (langgraph mis-pinned at 0.3.34, corrected) | Low | Tooling | Semport tooling must handle all three |
| R6 | crates.io names verified available; GitHub=BOHICA-LABS/ferrochain registered; publish-all.sh prepped — human has NOT yet run publish-all.sh (cargo login required). Time-sensitive. | High | pre-1 | Pending human action: `cargo login` + run publish-all.sh to reserve all ferrochain-* crate names |
| R7 | langchain-protocol v0.0.17 — no stable release; schema evolving. Port rationale is version-volatility, not immaturity (v3 streaming has 107 dedicated tests — corrected cert pass 9). | Low | Phase 1/3 | DOWNGRADED from Medium; full schema in .factory/semport/core/ANALYSIS-STATE.md |
| R8 | Splitters code-point vs byte-length parity: upstream `len()` calls on text are code-point counts — different split boundaries on non-ASCII. NOT covered by any upstream test. | High | Phase 1/3 | CRITICAL parity risk. Must become explicit BC + holdout scenario. Route to product-owner at Phase 1. |
| R9 | Platform API churn re-classified per D13 — SDK-1.2.9 endpoint catalog is design reference only; no conformance target. | Low | Phase 1 | Severity downgraded per D13 |
| R10 | Upstream coverage gap: NamedBarrierValue has NO dedicated unit test. EphemeralValue only 3 assert lines. Product-owner must author BCs + tests from behavior. | Medium | Phase 1 | Route to product-owner at Phase 1 |
| R11 | MCP upstream test voids: (1) mcp bare-ToolException re-raise path untested; (2) mcp `__aenter__` NotImplementedError contract untested. Same class as R8 and R10. | Medium | Phase 1/3 | Route to product-owner at Phase 1: must become explicit Red Gate tests |

## Skip Log

| Step | Skipped? | Justification |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Phase 0: Codebase Ingestion | yes | Greenfield — no existing Rust codebase to ingest. Replaced by semport-analyze of Python reference corpus. |

## Blocking Issues

<!-- Open issues only. Move resolved issues to cycles/v0.0.0-pre-pipeline/blocking-issues-resolved.md. -->

| ID | Issue | Severity | Blocking Phase | Owner | Resolution |
|----|-------|----------|----------------|-------|------------|
| B1 | direnv not allowed — .envrc present but unenabled; 4 AWS/Anthropic key names declared | Low | pre-1 | human | Run `direnv allow .` from project root |

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-13 |
| **Cycle** | v0.0.0-pre-pipeline |
| **Position** | pre-1, burst 42 complete. C1 COMPLETE: CLEAN(strict)=NO, streak 0/3, 1 MEDIUM correction applied (behavioral-intent A5). CONVERGENCE DEFINITION CORRECTED: adk-rust convergence requires BOTH (a) analysis novelty-LOW + explicit CONVERGED verdict AND (b) 3-CLEAN strict-zero. A6 deepening IN-PROGRESS to close depth gaps (realtime state machine, sandbox backends, RAG, skill negative paths, A2A client, ignored-test census). C2 HELD until A6 completes (frozen-HEAD rule). After A6 + 3-CLEAN: comparative assessment → HUMAN DIRECTION GATE → Phase 1. |
| **Key context** | D1-D16 locked. D16 ACTIVE: Rust-blindness rule in force. SWEEP CONFIRMATIONS: buffer_unordered nondeterminism (P-28), step-boundary checkpointing (P-29), transactional writes (P-20), AES envelope + plaintext events + swallowed re-encrypt. All 3 native-tls chains feature-gated. KEY GAPS (CONFIRMED): Domain A guardrail gap (P-59 UNMET), bare-String API keys (P-76), non-isolating default sandbox. P-71 RULED: STRONG STANDS (9/12, 3 exceptions architecturally grounded). R6 OPEN. R8/R10/R11 OPEN. |

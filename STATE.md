| Step | Agent | Status | Output |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| semport-analyze pass 2 — langgraph runtime+checkpoint+prebuilt | codebase-analyzer | DONE | .factory/semport/graph/ (5 deliverables; ~46,150 deep-scope LOC; key risks: LANGGRAPH_STRICT_MSGPACK RCE-guard, dual storage shapes, replay-on-resume semantic, DeltaChannel beta prune; vsdd-factory idioms transferable but durable/replay core is greenfield) |
| semport-analyze pass 3 — langchain_v1 | codebase-analyzer | DONE | .factory/semport/langchain/ (5 deliverables; 14,512 src LOC / 31,653 test LOC; ~87% weight in agents/; langgraph API surface = minimum ferrochain-graph public API frozen in behavioral-intent §5.1-5.4; SCOPE DECISION queued: subagent stream transformer v1 non-goal) |
| D11 design steers recorded (ferrochain-graph; from D9 early conversation) | human | DONE | D11.1 HYBRID execution model; D11.2 RUST-NATIVE checkpoint wire format (not byte-compatible w/ Python); D11.3 sync-default durability (deliberate deviation from upstream) |
| semport-analyze pass 4 — partners+standard-tests | codebase-analyzer | IN_PROGRESS | .factory/semport/partners/ |
| semport-analyze pass 5 — text-splitters+mcp-adapters | codebase-analyzer | IN_PROGRESS | .factory/semport/splitters/ + .factory/semport/mcp/ |

## Decisions Log

| ID | Decision | Rationale | Phase | Date | Made By |
|----|----------|-----------|-------|------|---------|
| D1 | AMENDED (human-approved 2026-07-12): langchain-community full 1,051-module port REMOVED from scope. Upstream archived 2026-06-19 (sunset announcement issue #674; replaced by standalone packages + in-app tools + MCP). New integration strategy: (a) integration trait contracts in ferrochain-core, (b) ferrochain-standard-tests conformance suite (port of libs/standard-tests), (c) NEW ferrochain-mcp crate — port of langchain-mcp-adapters, (d) curated demand-ranked community integration crates post-v1, (e) long tail out-of-tree conformance-validated | langchain-community archived upstream — full port is dead scope; MCP adapter is the live integration surface | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D2 | Reference version: langchain==1.3.13 (SHA 42f8f79), langgraph==1.2.9 (SHA 95af6a0), langchain-community==v0.4.2 (SHA 7c10a5f; ARCHIVED — curated-subset reference only), langchain-mcp-adapters==0.3.0 (SHA a61c783a7949719a8c3fbe4aeba961f45f3b7849) | Latest stable v1 line; full pins in reference-manifest.md v1.3.0 | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D3 | Early integrations: OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama first; then full partner set | Unblocks core use-cases earliest | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D4 | Single Cargo workspace, one repo, one pipeline; crates publish individually | Simplest topology for first release cycle | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D5 | semport-analyze must emit dependency-disposition.md per package (map/port/eliminate); numpy→ndarray, pandas→polars default; pydantic→serde/schemars requires dedicated ADR before BCs | Prevents unreviewed dep choices propagating into BCs | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D6 | RESOLVED — ferrochain (distinct brand; scored 23/25 vs 14/25 for langchain-* suffix; `langchain_rs` name blocked by crates.io name-normalization collision). Crate family: ferrochain, ferrochain-core, ferrochain-graph, ferrochain-checkpoint, ferrochain-openai, ferrochain-anthropic, ferrochain-ollama, ferrochain-community, ferrochain-splitters. Final crate names get ADR in architecture phase. Evidence: .factory/planning/naming-decision-study.md | Distinct brand maximizes positioning; suffix scheme is blocked | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D7 | Wave priority: core → graph → partners. LangGraph runtime + durable checkpointing is the P0 lead differentiator and ships immediately after ferrochain-core | White space analysis confirms graph-runtime-with-checkpointing + conformance suite + formal verification is unoccupied; rig v0.40 competitor velocity HIGH — must lead with graph | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D8 | Reference-application forcing functions + holdout scenario domains (human directive). Two archetypes serve dual purpose: (1) DESIGN FORCING FUNCTIONS for Phase 1 — PRD/architecture must demonstrate these workloads are supportable (capability checklist: durable multi-day graph runs, hierarchical sub-agent delegation/spawning, parallel fan-out, human-approval interrupts mid-run, quality-gate conditional routing, structured outputs, MCP tool integration, checkpoint/resume across process restarts). (2) HOLDOUT SCENARIO DOMAINS for Phase 2 — product-owner authors hidden acceptance scenarios in these domains; specific scenarios stay hidden from implementers per information-asymmetry rules; only the domains are public. Domain A: Virtual SOC analyst agent — long-running security investigations, SIEM/EDR tool calling via MCP, structured triage verdicts, human approval before containment actions, high-volume alert triage. Domain B: Dark factory (autonomous software development orchestrator) — VSDD-style multi-agent software factory built on ferrochain; behavioral references: /Users/jmagady/Dev/vsdd-factory (Rust cargo workspace — design reference for Rust multi-agent orchestration patterns) + https://factory.strongdm.ai/ (verified live HTTP 200). Downstream product concepts (out of this pipeline's scope, deferred to discovery mode post-convergence): SOC-analyst product + build-your-own-agents SaaS. | Concrete reference applications surface capability gaps before spec crystallization; information-asymmetric holdout domains enforce unbiased Phase 4 evaluation | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D9 | ferrochain-graph design consultation gate (human directive). Before ANY ferrochain-graph execution-model ADR is finalized, the architect MUST present ≥2 alternatives with production trade-offs (scheduling model, checkpoint atomicity, backpressure, cancellation, multi-tenant fairness) to the human for a design conversation. The Rust workspace at /Users/jmagady/Dev/vsdd-factory is designated PRIOR ART / EVIDENCE, explicitly NOT a template — "most productionally best, not just prior art" (human's words). Gate applies at Phase 1c architecture. | Human mandate: design consultation before ADR lock prevents premature architecture commit on the highest-risk component | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D10 | Production-grade constitution adopted (human directive). /Users/jmagady/Dev/ferrochain/CLAUDE.md (553 lines) authored by technical-writer from a full harvest of /Users/jmagady/Dev/prism/CLAUDE.md per direct human mandate ("EVERYTHING that applies to us"). Includes: Canonical Principle (Production-Grade Default, six rules + self-audit checklist), Correct Agent Routing companion, Source-of-Truth Precedence, TD-VSDD-053/059/060/091, BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN w/ strict-vs-PR-merge + frozen-HEAD rules, SID-1, SAP-1 (adapted), day-1 Rust conventions (rustls-tls mandatory, credential newtypes w/ redacted Debug, no-unwrap, non_exhaustive discipline, tokio async-first), git non-negotiables. Binds ALL agents from now (including spec/analysis agents). NOTE: CLAUDE.md sits on main which has no initial commit yet — gets committed in workspace-init commit (devops, Phase 1); do NOT attempt to commit repo-root files outside .factory/. | Human mandate: production-grade agent constitution must be in place before Phase 1 begins | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |
| D11 | ferrochain-graph design steers (from D9 early conversation 2026-07-12; formal ADR ratification still at Phase 1c). D11.1 Execution model: HYBRID — orchestrator-loop engine per run (compile-time write-isolation, single-writer checkpoint atomicity) wrapped by actor-style outer scheduler (multi-tenant fairness/quotas); serves embedded-library AND hosted-SaaS stances. D11.2 Checkpoint wire format: RUST-NATIVE msgpack-based + security-allowlist RCE-guard concept retained + one-way Python-checkpoint import tool; NOT byte-compatible with Python ormsgpack ext-table format. D11.3 Durability: port all three tiers (sync/async/exit) for API parity; ferrochain DEFAULTS to sync (crash-safe) — deliberate documented deviation from upstream defaults per production-grade constitution. | Human design-conversation preceding D9 gate; formal ADR ratification at Phase 1c | pre-1 | 2026-07-12 | human |

## Risk Register

| ID | Risk | Severity | Affects | Notes |
|----|------|----------|---------|-------|
| R1 | langgraph `scheduler-kafka` confirmed removed from langgraph 1.2.9. With D1 amended, treat as out-of-scope unless architecture finds a dependency | Low | Phase 1/3 | Effectively resolved by D1 amendment; flag if architecture phase surface it |
| R2 | langchain-community stable is 0.4.x; v1.0.0a1 tagged — API churn risk for community wave | Medium | Phase 3 | Phase community work last per D1 roadmap |
| R3 | LangGraph Platform SDK/CLI in scope → DTU_REQUIRED likely TRUE at P1-06 (proprietary SaaS backend; behavioral clone needed for holdout testing) | High | Phase 1/4 | Assess at P1-06; may become B-001 |
| R4 | Competing active `langgraph` crate on crates.io (updated 2026-07-01) — positioning risk | Medium | Phase 1 | Feeds market-intelligence-assessment gate |
| R5 | Three incompatible tag conventions across reference repos (PyPI `==`, bare semver, path-style) — tag-sort bug already triggered (langgraph mis-pinned at 0.3.34, corrected) | Low | Tooling | Semport tooling must handle all three |
| R6 | crates.io names verified available; GitHub=BOHICA-LABS/ferrochain registered; publish-all.sh prepped — human has NOT yet run publish-all.sh (cargo login required). Time-sensitive. | High | pre-1 | Pending human action: `cargo login` + run publish-all.sh to reserve all ferrochain-* crate names |
| R7 | langchain-protocol v0.0.17 discovered as upstream dep of langchain-core (semport pass 1); immature package with no stable release. Port-as-provisional strategy. | Medium | Phase 1/3 | Identified in semport pass 1. Strategy: port as provisional, monitor for breaking changes. Full schema in .factory/semport/core/ANALYSIS-STATE.md |

## Skip Log

| Step | Skipped? | Justification |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Phase 0: Codebase Ingestion | yes | Greenfield — no existing Rust codebase to ingest. Replaced by semport-analyze of Python reference corpus. |

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-13 |
| **Cycle** | v0.0.0-pre-pipeline |
| **Position** | pre-1, burst 5 complete. Passes 2-3 DONE: langgraph (~46,150 deep-scope LOC; 5 deliverables at .factory/semport/graph/), langchain_v1 (14,512 src / 31,653 test LOC; 5 deliverables at .factory/semport/langchain/). D11 design steers recorded (HYBRID execution model, RUST-NATIVE checkpoint, sync-default durability). Passes 4-5 IN_PROGRESS (partners+standard-tests → .factory/semport/partners/, text-splitters+mcp-adapters → .factory/semport/splitters/+mcp/). Remaining queue: langgraph-platform SDK/CLI deep pass, core deepening pass, then semport convergence → Phase 1. Queued Phase 1 gate decisions: (a) subagent stream transformer v1 non-goal, (b) final crate-name ADR, (c) license decision (MIT-derivative attribution). |
| **Key context** | D1-D11 locked. R6 OPEN: cargo login + publish-all.sh still needed (time-sensitive). CLAUDE.md on main — NO initial commit yet; devops commits at workspace-init Phase 1. Ref corpus pinned: langchain==1.3.13, langgraph==1.2.9, langchain-community==v0.4.2 (archived), langchain-mcp-adapters==0.3.0. D9 gate: Phase 1c architect MUST show ≥2 graph alternatives + production trade-offs to human before ADR lock. D11 formal ADR ratification at Phase 1c.

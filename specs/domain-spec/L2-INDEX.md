changelog:
  - "v1.24 (fix-burst-280/wave-c/2026-07-28): Document Map Lines→Size column replacement. Rationale: a precise numeric line-count estimate held in a separate index file decays silently on every shard edit — no gate detects the drift; this burst found four cells stale by +64 to +174 lines (capabilities-p0.md, entities-server.md, ubiquitous-language-server.md, bounded-contexts.md). This is the same structural-decay class TD-VSDD-091 addresses for file:NNN citations — not a pinned cite, but the same unbounded-drift property with no detection gate. S/M/L/XL bands update only when a shard crosses a tier boundary, which coincides with the DF-021 split review; maintenance cost is already paid at that trigger. Column name diverges from the upstream template's Tokens column by orchestrator authorization (Path 2, fix-burst-280); spec-steward holds the governance record — this divergence is intentional, not accidental drift. Band assignments (all 14 rows): XL: capabilities-p1-p2.md; L: entities-graph.md, ubiquitous-language-core.md, bounded-contexts.md; S: assumptions.md, risks.md, differentiators.md; M: all remaining."
  - "v1.23 (fix-burst-280/wave-c/2026-07-28): Document Map full line-count correction — all 14 rows verified against source shards. Four stale entries corrected: capabilities-p0.md ~140→~228, entities-server.md ~95→~201, ubiquitous-language-server.md ~100→~164, bounded-contexts.md ~155→~329."
  - "v1.22 (fix-burst-280/wave-c/2026-07-28): Count-desync correction — Document Map risks.md row: (8 risks)→(9 risks) and line estimate ~51→~79; assumptions.md line estimate ~48→~54. Full ID count sweep: CAP 38, DI 15, DEC 13, ASM 9, R 9, FM 19 all verified correct against source shards."
  - "v1.21 (fix-burst-280/wave-c/2026-07-28): R-009 added to risks.md (no v1 migration path for Python LangGraph checkpoints; orchestrator-approved gap coverage). ID Registry R-NNN count 8→9. ASM-007 Validation Method and Dependency Map updated with R-009 bidirectional link; assumptions.md D11 added to decisions list."
  - "v1.20 (fix-burst-280/wave-c/2026-07-28): assumptions.md — ASM-007 impact re-derivation (F-P175-C207). Impact if Wrong corrected Low→Medium; stale 'import tool in scope' citation replaced with ADR-002 §Consequences anchor; ASM-007 added to Assumption Dependency Map tracing to CAP-005."
  - "v1.19 (fix-burst-278/wave-b/2026-07-28): VectorStore retriever seam — three shards updated per D-48/D-44/D-45. capabilities-p1-p2.md §CAP-027/§CAP-028: VectorStoreRetriever lifetime annotation removed (verify-signature-canon S2 zero hits), as_retriever receiver corrected to self: Arc<Self> (S1b zero hits), backing-store borrow form corrected to Arc<dyn VectorStore>, k/fetch_k/lambda_mult rejection semantics added per D-44. entities-graph.md §VectorStore/§Relationships-Summary: VectorStore entity as_retriever receiver and Relationships Summary borrow-backed form corrected. ubiquitous-language-core.md §VectorStoreRetriever/§VectorStore: term borrow-based forms corrected. Post-fix: verify-signature-canon S1b=0, S2=0; borrow-backed VectorStoreRetriever form absent from all domain-spec shards."
  - "v1.18 (FC-4/burst-277/2026-07-28): False-closure FC-4 correction — 'PO BC obligations' stale-completed-delegation residue removed from 3 shards. capabilities-p1-p2.md v1.17→v1.18 (3 instances at CAP-034 x2, CAP-035 x1; all converted to past-tense 'Authored BCs' citations). entities-graph.md v1.12→v1.13 (1 instance: §PreToolDecision PendingHumanApproval). ubiquitous-language-core.md v1.8→v1.9 (1 instance: §PreToolDecision definition). All 5 instances confirmed stale-completed: BC-2.05.008, BC-2.06.004, BC-2.06.005, BC-2.08.010, BC-2.10.005, BC-2.10.006, BC-2.06.006 all exist. The v1.14 '4 verified structural/legitimate' count was inaccurate — those hits included these now-corrected stale-delegation instances."
  - "v1.17 (F-P173-104/F-P173-106/F-P173-702/burst-276/2026-07-27): bounded-contexts.md v1.4→v1.5 (F-P173-104: remove ferrochain-graph from ferrochain-tools dep list per ADR-020 Decision 1; inline note added citing D-24 ActionRisk-from-core rationale); capabilities-p1-p2.md v1.16→v1.17 (F-P173-106: CAP-038 regex dependency confirmed net-new per ADR-020 Decision 7, stale confirm-instruction removed; F-P173-702: CAP-029 ADR-014 Decision 4 → ADR-017 Decision 4 for InMemoryVectorStore/Arc-DI)."

# L2 Domain Specification: ferrochain

> **Sharded artifact (DF-021).** This index provides navigation and summary.
> Detail lives in per-section files listed below. Each section targets
> 800-1,200 tokens for optimal LLM consumption.

## Domain Summary

ferrochain occupies the agent-orchestration domain: composing AI model calls, tool
invocations, and durable state transitions into resumable graphs with human-in-the-loop
interrupts, structured checkpointing, typed error propagation, and provider conformance —
expressed as a Rust async-native port of the LangChain v1 semantic surface.

## Document Map

> **Size bands (S/M/L/XL):** S = <100 lines · M = 100–300 · L = 300–600 · XL = >600.
> Update a band only when a shard crosses a tier boundary — which coincides with the DF-021
> split review, so the maintenance cost is already paid at that point. This column is an
> orchestrator-authorized project-local divergence from the upstream template's `Tokens`
> column; spec-steward holds the governance record.
